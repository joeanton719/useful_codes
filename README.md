# useful_codes
codes related to hyperparameter tuning and some classes, functions, etc. I have created to optmize classification problems (Continuously being updated ). 

### 1) Grid_Random_Search: 
Codes for GridSearch & RandomSearch HP Tuning for classification algos. 

### 2) Hyperopt:
Codes for HP tuning using Hyperopt for selected classification algos.

### 3) Optuna:
Codes for HP tuning using Optuna for selected classification algos.

### 3) Scikit_opt_codes:
Codes for HP tuning using Scikit Optimize for selected classification algos.

### 4) Ready_Codes:
* Includes classes I have created for quickly checking training scores using 30+ classification algorithms, model validation, calibration, transforming continuous variables using 
log, power, box-cox, etc, selecting the best feature selection techniques,
* Libraries to import,
* Various codes for feature selection techniques,
*and so on...
